## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Serithal/MAGD150/edit/gh-pages/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

## My Projects

**Lab_03** [Click Here to visit Lab 3 code](https://github.com/Serithal/MAGD150/blob/Lab_03/sketch.js) 
In this lab there a a couple mathmatical calculations that are printed when the program is started, a blue circle follows the mouse around the canvas, and there is a small oval that is stuck in a single column on the left side of the canvas. Both the blue circle and the white oval's position change based off of the mouses X and Y position.

**Lab_04** [Click Here to visit Lab 4 code](https://github.com/Serithal/MAGD150/blob/Lab_04/sketch.js)
In this lab a pizza is made, there is a moving piece of pepperoni and clicking while inside the pizza crust would create peppers. There was a plan to include more toppings but the code kept crashing and it was therefore never finished.

**Lab_05** [Click Here to visit Lab 5 code](https://github.com/Serithal/MAGD150/blob/Lab_05/sketch.js)
In this lab a TV was programed with a rectanglular button on the bottom right which when held down would cause the TV to turn on and a circle would bounce around the display and change colors when coliding with the side.

**Lab_06** [Click Here to visit Lab 6 code](https://github.com/Serithal/MAGD150/blob/Lab_06/sketch.js)
In this lab a small rectanglular button of varying size would appear at a random position inside the canvas that when pressed would cause two pakman characters to spawn and spin around the center of the canvas with one being larger than the other and changing color. Both the pakman characters would spin a different speeds as well.

**Lab_07**[Click Here to visit Lab 7 code](https://github.com/Serithal/MAGD150/blob/Lab_07/sketch.js)
In this Lab there is a snow class that is created that would cause snow to fly across the canvas with text appearing in white on a dark grey background that sai "its snowing". By creating a snow class I could repeatedly add a callback to cause more snow to fall with each snow partical coming out in varying size.
